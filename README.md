# Building-AI-models-that-predict-biodiversity-hotspots-using-eDNA-bathymetry-and-environmental-data
Environmental DNA (eDNA), ROV imagery, and oceanographic sensors offer new ways to link physical features to living communities. The challenge is integrating these multimodal data streams into a unified framework that can predict biodiversity in unexplored areas.
